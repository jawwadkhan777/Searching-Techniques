# Searching Algorithms in Java

This repository contains implementations of fundamental searching algorithms in Java, specifically Linear Search and Binary Search. These algorithms are crucial for understanding data structures and algorithms, and they form the backbone of efficient searching in various applications.

## Project Overview ðŸ“š

As part of my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java, I implemented the Linear and Binary Search algorithms. I gained this knowledge through YouTube tutorials, and I have put it into practice using IntelliJ IDEA.

### Linear Search
- **Description:** Linear Search is a simple searching algorithm that checks each element in a list until the desired element is found or the list ends.
- **Complexity:** O(n)

### Binary Search
- **Description:** Binary Search is a more efficient algorithm for sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half and works only on a sorted list.
- **Complexity:** O(log n)

## Get Started ðŸš€

To get started with this project, simply clone this repository and open the desired search algorithm file in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA). No additional setup is required!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jawwadkhan777/Searching-Techniques.git
```
